# **Part 1: Generating Ideas**
1. Grocery Inventory Tracker: an app that keeps track of the grocery you purchased as well as their expiration dates, prevents user from overshopping unnecessary items and wasting food.
2. Pet Health Tracker: an app that keeps track of the health status and any documents or reminders related to the user's pet. 
3. Fitness Planner and Tracker: an app that helps user plan their daily fitness routines and track their progress.
4. Movie Wishlist: an app that keeps track of the movies that one has watched and plans to watch. Similar to GoodReads but for movies instead of for books.
5. Sleep Journal: an app that encourages user to develop healthy sleep habits and document their sleep times and qualities.
6. Stargazing Guide: an app that provides geolocatio-specific guidelines and tutorials on stargazing, as well as real-time weather forecasting. Users can post about their stargazing journey on the platform to share with others. 



# **Part 2: Evaluating Ideas**
I chose Grocery Inventory Tracker and Pet Health Tracker because these two had the most personal meaning to me. I have struggled with food waste for a long time, and always wished that I could have a system to keep track of what I already have left in the fridge. As for Pet Health Tracker, it would be a tool very useful for me personally because I have two cats of my own, and one of them have a chronic condition that needs daily symptom documentations. I will be evaluating both ideas using the guideline provided on the project website.

**Grocery Inventory Tracker**
* Category: Productivity, Substainability
* Mobile: push notification for expiration date reminders, item restock alert, and camera for uploading item image.
* Story: Encourages the practice of sustainability and prevention of food waste.
* Market: Anyone who shops for grocery could be benefited from this app to keep their inventory organized. 
* Habit: the average person would use this app everytime they need to update the amount of items in inventory, or add/delete items from the inventory.
* Scope: The primary scope of this app is a tracking tool that include the following core feature: add/delete/update item inventory, create shopping list, expiration date alert. It will be fairly doable to implement most of these features by the end of the program. However, I hope to incorporate more advanced features like supporting barcode scanning and computer vision in future iterations. 

**Pet Health Tracker**
* Category: Productivity, Health
* Mobile: this app is inherently better suited as a mobile app because it provides a convenient way to document pet health status as well as to receive notification/reminders about important events like administering medication, vet appointment, and vaccinations, etc. 
* Story: the value of this app is very clear and compelling, which is to maintain the wellbeing of our beloved furry friends. My peers responded very positively to the idea of this app. 
* Market: Anyone who has pets could be benefited from this app. I expect the scale of market to be quite large, since 66% of American households own a pet as of 2024. 
* Habit: The frequency of use depends on the purpose of use. For users tracking specific symptoms or using this app as a reminder for medications, the frequency would be likely one or twice per day. For users using this app as a place to store all of their pet's medical records, the use will vary depending on how often they would like to access those records. 
* Scope: this app has a fairly well-defined scope and would be moderately challenging to implement before the end of program. Even a simplified version with only the symptom tracking feature and reminder would be interesting to implement. 


# 2.3 Final Decision
Based on my app evaluations, I have decided to build the Pet Health Tracker, as it has a greater market and a more well-defined scope. I also received more positive feedbacks from family and friends on Pet Health Tracker than the Grocery Inventory Tracker.
